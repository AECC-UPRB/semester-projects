                    <p>We teach entrepreneurial skills to university students in an extreme hands-on environment. We are looking forward to bring this event to our university to get the startup community in our campus so college students can get the experience of building their own startup in one weekend.</p>

                    <p>We are a group of students from the University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras, wanting to offer support and guidance to women interested in Computer Science. Our goal is to outreach not only women, but a minority represented in our science. We don't segregate ourselves, we support diversity. We also aim to change the erroneous image that can have the students about Computer Science. You don't have to be a "gamer" or a "hacker" to learn Computer Science and succeed.</p>

                    <p>Website to orientate students of any age what is Computer Science and why you should try it out. Why? Most school guiders do not even mention Computer Science as an option when you are applying to school in PR. This will not be limited to PR, therefore it would be as accessible as possible to anyone who wants to know what Computer Science really is.</p>
